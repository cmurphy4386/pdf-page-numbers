# PDF Page Numbers

*Page X of Y on a scan pack.*

## About

**PDF Page Numbers** is a document utility. Stamp page numbers on a PDF footer and write a new file.

A merged scan has no page numbers. A full editor is overkill.

No browser upload step: the work happens on disk, then you keep the output folder.

## What's included

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## What it does

- Position and font size
- Optional start number
- Range or all pages
- Leaves the original

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.

## Desktop build
